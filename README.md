# CST-simulation-macros
Repository to store various macros useful for CST simulations

If you want to use one of the macros, simply download the file you want and open it in the CST macro editor located in `Home --> Macros --> Open VBA Macro Editor`. You can also add this macro to quick access by clicking `Home --> Macros --> Import VBA Macro`

If you would like to develop your own macro to script task parameters in CST, I would recommend using [this link](https://space.mit.edu/RADIO/CST_online/mergedProjects/VBA_DES/special_vbacommands/simulationtaskobject.htm) to start.
